# From Shock to Strategy: The Data Behind Customer Loss + Blueprint for Recovery   
***A Power BI project to analyze the impact of a demand crisis on customer behavior, delivery performance, and revenue — and design a recovery framework using customer segmentation and re-acquisition insights.***

This project was my submission for the **Codebasics Resume Project Challenge** for July 2025.

## ❗The Problem
A mid-sized online food delivery platform faced a severe demand shock between **June and September 2025**, leading to:

- A **71% drop** in gross order value  
- A **44% decline** in customer ratings (from 4.5 to 2.5)  
- A **62% reduction** in monthly transacting users  

The business needed answers on:

- What triggered the collapse — customers, partners, or delivery operations?  
- Which customers could be recovered versus lost permanently?  
- How to prioritize re-acquisition and rebuild loyalty efficiently?  

Decision-making was challenged by fragmented datasets across orders, customer sentiment, and delivery logs.

## 📝 Overview

This project dissects the **FoodTech crisis period (Jan–Sep 2025)** to identify:

1. **Demand & Revenue Shifts** — Pre- vs post-crisis comparisons across order value, frequency, and customer base.  
2. **Customer Attrition Patterns** — Loyalty, value tier, and sentiment changes.  
3. **Operational Disruptions** — Delivery delays, partner churn, and city-level trends.  
4. **Recovery Framework** — Segmentation of customers based on revenue-at-risk and re-acquisition potential.  

**Goal:** Build a Power BI dashboard that allows business leaders to quickly diagnose the extent of demand erosion and target the right customers for recovery.

## 🔢 Data Sources

Primary datasets were simulated for analysis using anonymized FoodTech business data (2024–2025):

- **Orders & Transactions:** Order IDs, order value, frequency, cuisine, and delivery time.  
- **Customer Ratings & Sentiment:** Monthly average ratings and text sentiment scores.  
- **Delivery Partner Data:** Employment type, SLA deviation, and order fulfillment.  
- **Restaurant Partner Data:** Active vs churned restaurants, partner category (restaurant/cloud kitchen).  
- **Competitor Benchmarks:** GOV, MTU, and transacting partner metrics for Swiggy and Zomato.  
- **Acquisition Channels:** Organic vs paid user sign-ups by month.

## ✅ Solution: Dashboard & Analytics

I designed a **Power BI dashboard** with interconnected views across five analytical lenses:

| Visual Section | Purpose / Key Insight |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Crisis Overview** | Compared pre- and post-crisis GOV, AOV, and MTU trends — revealing a 71% GOV drop driven primarily by user churn, not pricing. |
| **Customer Segmentation** | Created recovery segments – *Fence Sitters*, *High-Value Recoverable*, *Light Users*, and *Unrecoverable* – visualized revenue-at-risk and recovery potential. |
| **Operational Insights** | Analyzed SLA deviations showing an 18-min average delay across all delivery types (vs ~4.7 mins pre-crisis), disproving employment-type bias. |
| **Partner Stability** | Showed restaurant churn (9.7%) had minimal impact on order composition, implying demand-side disruption over supply-side. |
| **Acquisition Trends** | Highlighted the collapse of organic user growth (from 11K to <300 signups/month) and rising CAC driven by dependence on paid ads. |

## 🌟 Impact: What the Analysis Revealed

### 🧠 Key Insights
- **Customer churn**, not restaurant or delivery issues, was the primary cause of decline.  
- **Organic growth collapsed**, tripling acquisition costs.  
- **High-value and loyal segments nearly disappeared**, indicating poor retention strategies.  
- **Order value composition stayed stable**, suggesting no real “survival shift” — users didn’t downtrade, they simply left.  

### 💼 Recovery Framework
- **Fence Sitters:** Re-engage via loyalty bonuses and limited-time offers.  
- **High-Value Recoverable:** Personalized outreach and early-access incentives.  
- **Light Users:** Retarget through paid channels emphasizing trust and delivery reliability.  
- **Unrecoverable:** Exclude from short-term retention budgets.
